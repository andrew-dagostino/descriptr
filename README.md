### `exit`

```
Exit Descriptr.

    Usage:
        exit
```

### `export_graph`

```
Export a CSV representation courses. Importable by Gephi.

Usage: export_graph [<filename>] [-n]

    <filename> : Optional. The name of the exported CSV file. Default 'out.csv".

                    search. Otherwise, outputs a graph of the whole course calendar.
```

**How to use the exported graph in Gephi:**

Once you have an exported csv graph from Descriptr, you can import the basic csv file into Gephi for further processing.

Step 1. Open Gephi

Step 2. Click File

Step 3. Select the Descriptr ".csv" you want to import and click Ok/Open

Step 4. Under the seperator dropdown select semicolon.

Step 5. Imort as: Edges table

Step 6. Click Next

Step 7. Click Finish

Step 8. Click OK.

Step 9. Repeat Steps 2-7 except for step 5 where you Import as: Nodes table.

Step 10. For the second import, Select "Append to existing workspace"


You now have a useful workspace you can process in Gephi.

### Prerequisite

The `Prerequisite` objects functions in the following way:

`Enum : PrerequisiteState`:
* `Regular`
* `Optional`
* `Any`

`Prerequisite`:
* `courses: List<Course>` = `Courses` this `Prerequisite` object applies to
* `prerequisites: List<Prerequisite>` = other `Prerequisite` objects this `Prerequisite` object applies to
* `state: PrerequisiteState` = one of the above enum states
* `anyAmount: int` = 0 if `PrerequisiteState` is not `Any`, 1-n if `Any`
* `other: string` = If the prerequisites listed from the course aren't divisible into individual courses (e.g. `"All Phase 3 courses"`, `"4.00 credits including X-course"`).

`Prerequisite` objects are then stored in a `List<Prerequisite>` on the `Course` that they apply to.

Each `Prerequisite` object would be broken down until all of the `Courses` in them have the same predicate/logical state.

If a prerequisite has the `other` variable filled, the prerequisite will have to be manually verified (unless we store a list of all potential situations (e.g. have a list of all Phase 3 courses, or a value for the student's total credits accumulated)).

#### Example:
If a course had the following prerequisites:
* A course
* B course or (2 of C, D, E courses)
* F course optional

The `List<Prerequisite>` on the `Course` would look like:
* **1** - Prerequisite(
    &emsp; courses: { A },
    &emsp; prerequisites: { },
    &emsp; state: Regular,
    &emsp; anyAmount: 0)
* **2** - Prerequisite(
    &emsp; courses: { B },
    &emsp; prerequisites: {
        &emsp; &emsp; **3** - Prerequisite(
            &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; courses: { C, D, E },
            &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; prerequisites: { },
            &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; state: Any,
            &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; anyAmount: 2) },
    &emsp; state: Any,
    &emsp; anyAmount: 1)
* **4** - Prerequisite(
    &emsp; courses: { F },
    &emsp; prerequisites: { },
    &emsp; state: Optional,
    &emsp; anyAmount: 0)

Where:
* Prerequisite 1 is just a regular prerequisite where the course(s) (A in this case) are just required like usual, so if you have A the object will collapse into True, otherwise False.
* Prerequisite 2 is a _compound prerequisite_ where if you have B, that fulfils the "Any 1" requirements and Prerequisite 3 doesn't matter, collapsing the prerequisite into True. However, if not it will look at Prerequisite 3 which is a group of courses (C, D, E). If you have "Any 2" of those courses, then the whole compound prerequisite will collapse into True, but if not Prerequisite 2 and 3 will be False.
* Prerequisite 4 is an optional prerequisite so it doesn't actually matter for the calculation of prerequisites.
